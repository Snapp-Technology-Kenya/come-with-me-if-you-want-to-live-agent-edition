# Come with me if you want to live (agent edition)

This codebase is used as sample code for the talk "Come with me if you want to live".

It is based on the approach of creating agents and sub-agents to specialise on specific tasks and provide context for them. This is another way of splitting the context up even further.

The sample app follows a typical pattern of having an SPA UI and a single rest based api. It is designed to provide ai generated description of an image.

# Status

This is skeleton app, containing primarily instructions for the AI. The aim is to provide a template that you can start with. Some structure that seems to work.
